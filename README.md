# j-arc

The `j-ARC` is a collection of pre-built microservices that aim to reduce time to market for enterprise projects. Large enterprises usually face a similar set of challenges when developing cloud native platforms as part of digital transformation efforts or the creation of new products. The services are implemented as Maven Packages, allowing you to install them into existing Spring Boot applications. Our recommended approach is to deploy these services as standalone micro-services in Docker.
